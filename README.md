# DevOps for Privacy Offices

### We envision a future in which the public can easily understand how and why personally identifiable information gets collected by government agencies. 

To get there, we're working with federal privacy offices and structuring data from PDFed privacy compliance documents (Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) and System of Record Notices (SORNs). By structuring data, we're equipping privacy offices with the ability to more quickly search through these documents, reducing unnecessary manual practices and laying a foundation for them to collaborate with engineering teams.

This project is funded by [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/).

Our phase three work is happening in partnership with [the GSA's Privacy Office](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program).


<!--- ### We believe this model will lay the foundation for: 

- **New Search Capabilities:**

- **Speed up Compliance:**

- **More Context for risk assessment:**

- **Reduce scope of breaches:**

- **Speed up Compliance:**

- **Increase accuracy:**
